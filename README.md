# Weather Dashboard Challenge

## Description
In this challenge, the task was to allow the user to find the weather today and the next five days in any city of their choosing. I used open weather api to help with this task. The previous cities users had searched would then show up as buttons below, so you could quickly go back to them. I found this task quite difficult, the concept of API's is still quite alien to me and i had some trouble with the layout of the consequent days of weather and how they are presented.
